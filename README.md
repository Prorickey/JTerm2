## Introduction
This repository includes various assembly language programs and exercises completed as part of the JTerm class "From Transistors to Operating Systems". The course covers the fundamentals of computer architecture, assembly language programming, and the transition from hardware to software.

## Course Overview
"From Transistors to Operating Systems" is an intensive course that explores the following topics:
- Basic digital logic and transistor-level design
- Microarchitecture and instruction set architecture (ISA)
- Assembly language programming
- System calls and operating system fundamentals

# Digital Logic Sim
The digital logic sim folder contains my game files for the beginning of the course. We used Digital Logic Sim to learn about how logic gates worked and how chips were built. We learned simple chip structures such as arithmatic logic units and latches.

# QtSpim and MIPS Assembly
After learning about logic gates, we moved on to learning the MIPS assembly language and used QtSpim to simulate the MIPS cpu. I organized the `QtSpim` folder into days since we made so many assembly programs. Included is the pdf with our problem sets for reference.
